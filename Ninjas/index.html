          With a shimmering white coat, unicorns are known to dazzle. Ninjas are
          exact opposite, but don't think their black clothes are a fashion
          mistake. They use them to stay out of sight in bushes, shadows, and
          moonlight nights.

        <p>
          Ninjas are tactical experts. Before you've realized a ninja attack is
          underway, they will sneak into your house, disable your alarms, and
          eat your cookies. And the while, the unicorns are still wandering
          somewhere in a meadow.

        <h2 class="font green">Weaponry</h2>
        <p>
          Ninjas are experts in hand-to-hand combat and masters of many exotic
          weapons, including the <i>ninjato</i> and <i>katana</i> (ninja
          swords), <i>shuriken</i> (throwing stars), and <i>yumi</i> (bow). But
          unicorns are tough competitors, with an unbreakable horn that never
          gets misplaced.
